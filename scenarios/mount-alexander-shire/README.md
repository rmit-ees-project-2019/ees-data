This directory contains all scenarios for a given shire. Things to note:
* The `/data` directory is just for storing various data we receive from the emergency services
* The `/app-data` directory contains files used by the EES web application
* The MATSim network file `./*network.xml.gz` is stored
once at the top level and then referenced by all the scenarios here
